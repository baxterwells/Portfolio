## A Forest Scene - [Play Here](https://misnomer2.itch.io/a-forest-scene)

[![*A Forest Scene* splash image.](<Assets/A Forest Scene/AForestSceneDay2.png> "Click to play 'A Forest Scene!'")](https://misnomer2.itch.io/a-forest-scene)

***A Forest Scene*** is a passive, procedurally-generated simulation built from the ground-up and drawn by hand using the GameMaker Studio 2 game engine.

All dynamic elements in the game are randomly generated, so every time you load the game, the scene will always be different. The weather patterns, locations of grass and flowers, and all animal behaviors are unique every time the game is played. Trees are grown using procedural generation. Some notable technologies that I have implemented in this game include the following:

- A completely self-sustaining weather system
- Procedurally-generated trees, coded by hand
- Everything has been drawn by hand
- GLSL shader writing (used for blending colors in the sky and viewing through leaves, tall grass, and flowers)
- Animal behaviors modeled from observing their real-life counterparts

## Plundered & Going Under - [Play Here](https://misnomer2.itch.io/plundered-and-going-under) (Game Jam Submission)

***Plundered & Going Under*** was made in 3 hours for Trijam #195 using GameMaker Studio 2.

*You've just plundered some booty from a nearby treasure trove, and you're trying to get back to the mainland -- but your boat starts to spring leaks! Choose between tossing some of your treasure overboard to sink slower or take time to repair your ship. How much treasure can you reach the mainland with, if any at all?*

## Procedural Content Studies
I have taken direct studies into the use of procedural content in video games -- such as the terrain generation in Minecraft! Below are some examples of the results of these studies.

### Terrain Generation
